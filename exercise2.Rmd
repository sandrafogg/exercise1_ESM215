#this is the highest in geology
#then we break dataset into subsets where each subset is one rock type, geology I, II, III
#we are developing a hierarchy here
#have to do it inside of each rock class
#compare within each geological starta
#once in that rock category, what is the next most associated variable to land cover
#they all recursively partition the data into different subsets
#as we work our way down the tree we want to increase predictive sk
